# About personal-blog

The repo for my personal blog, now accessible at [danielbower.com](https://danielbower.com).

My blog is built using Jekyll and based on a modified version of [jekyll-simple](https://github.com/wild-flame/jekyll-simple) by [David Lin](https://github.com/wild-flame), thanks David!

This is the fourth time I have re-platformed my blog since launching it in ~2004 using Typepad. Since then I have used Blogger, Wordpress and Tumblr, but this is the first time I have handled all the code myself. I am grateful to [Dr. Daniel Nememyi](https://danielnemenyi.net/) my lecturer at King's College, my friends [Eugenie](https://github.com/eugenierqs) and [Matt](https://github.com/matteunson) for countless amounts of technical support and also my friend [Lawrence](https://lawrencebrown.eu/) for his aesthetic input.
