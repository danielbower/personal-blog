# About personal-blog
Ther repo for my personal blog. It is currently accessible via a private Netlify URL, however I plan to migrate it to [danielbower.com](https://danielbower.com) once I have completed work on the relaunch.

My blog is built using Jekyll and based on a modified version of [jekyll-simple](https://github.com/wild-flame/jekyll-simple) by [David Lin](https://github.com/wild-flame), thanks David!

This is the fourth time I have re-platformed my blog since launching it in ~2004 using Typepad. Since then I have used Blogger and Tumblr, but this is the first time I have handled all the code myself. I am grateful to [Dr. Daniel Nememyi](https://danielnemenyi.net/) my lecturer at King's College, my friend [Eugenie](https://github.com/eugenierqs) for countless amounts of technical support and also my friend [Lawrence](https://lawrencebrown.eu/) for his asethetic input.
