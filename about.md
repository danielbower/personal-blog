I'm Dan, a product manger and entrepreneur originally from Birmingham in the UK and now living in Hackney with my partner, son and daughter.

I studied Politics and Economics at the University of Manchester before moving to London in 2006.

In 2008, along with Duncan Jennings, Max Jennings and Richard Foister I founded VoucherCodes which grew into Europe’s largest online coupon business. In 2011 VoucherCodes was sold to RetailMeNot, Inc. of Austin Texas where I took on responsibility for product management for all of their European businesses. RetailMeNot had its IPO on the NASDAQ in the summer of July 2013.

In 2015 the same team launched Hoop, a platform that connected families with local activity organisers. Hoop was twice voted an ‘App of the Year’ by Apple. It was installed over 1.5M times and its tools were used by over 5,000 small businesses to manage schedules, handle bookings and take payment. Hoop was closed in the summer of 2020.

I have recently completed a master's degree at The Department of Digital Humanities (DDH), King's College London. My research examined the relationship between monopolies and innovation, specifically, if the presence of large technology platforms reduces the flow of venture capital funding into startups operating in similar markets. This idea was given the term 'Kill Zone' by Albert Wegner of Union Sqaure Ventures and there have been a number of academic papers written on the topic over the past few years. I plan to publish my findings later this year.

In my spare time I'm a keen runner, and organise Hackney’s junior parkrun every Sunday in London Fields. I sit on the board of Picfair, a licensing platform for photography, and have made a handful of other angel investments.

I blog on a [variety of topics](/archive/), however the focus tends to be startups and political economy, ideally a combination of the two!
