I'm Dan, a product manger and entrepreneur originally from Birmingham in the UK and now living in Hackney with my partner and son.

I studied Politics and Economics at the University of Manchester before moving to London in 2006.

In 2008, along with Duncan Jennings, Max Jennings and Richard Foister I founded VoucherCodes which grew into Europe’s largest online coupon business. In 2011 VoucherCodes was sold to RetailMeNot, Inc. of Austin Texas where I took on responsibility for product management for all of their European businesses. RetailMeNot had its IPO on the NASDAQ in the summer of July 2013.

In 2015 the same team launched Hoop, a platform that connected families with local activity organisers. Hoop was twice voted an ‘App of the Year’ by Apple. It was installed over 1.5M times and its tools were used by over 5,000 small businesses to manage schedules, handle bookings and take payment. Hoop was closed in the summer of 2020.

I am currently studying towards a master’s degree in Digital Economy in The Department of Digital Humanities (DDH) at King’s College London.

In my spare time I'm a keen runner, and organise Hackney’s junior parkrun every Sunday in London Fields. I also sit on the board of Picfair, a licensing platform for photography, and have made a handful of other angel investments.

I blog around once a week on a [variety of topics](/archive/), however recently my posts have aligned closely with my [research interests](/research/).
