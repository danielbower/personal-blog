If The West Wing predicted the rise of Obama then surely The Thick of It did the same for the current MP housing allowance debacle. The scenes of Tucker sprinting across Westminster to stop Hugh talking to a reporter about his “huge grace and favour home” were surely mimicked over the past few days.

And how did Tucker solve the problem? Hugh’s house was sold for 40% under the asking price. Take note Hazel Blears.

Just a pity something so funny is so accurate.
