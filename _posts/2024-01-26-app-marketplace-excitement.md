og: "The app marketplace excitement that wasn't"

When I woke up this morning a quick scan of the headlines left me thinking Apple had gone an done something pretty interesting. The concerns about them circumventing the DMA had been wrong (mostly) and they were going to introduce something exciting, namely third party app marketplaces, that would enable the side loading of apps with Apple taking 0.5â‚¬ per install. Now people in the Tim Sweeney camp would argue that this isn't true side loading, as they still require intermediaries that Apple has control over, but it felt, in the fog of the the early morning at least, like a huge step forward.

My marketplace brain immediately started thinking about the new opportunities this would enable. By way of a simple example, imagine an app review website, that spins up their own marketplace in order to combine all their knowledge with install links to the best apps. Sure they'd be charged a small fee for each download, but as long as they were monetising the traffic sufficiently they could still make for pretty interesting businesses that add a load of value to the end user. I started messaging some friends who work in some relevant sectors to share the good news.

And then the excitement faded. Because, as the morning rolled on, and more people trawled through the docs Apple had released it became clear that this wasn't some spark of innovation, it was, much like the payments despite last year, just a cynical attempt to maintain control over their walled garden.

I am not going to try and create an authoritative list of the barriers Apple has put up here and no doubt more information will come to light. But from the reputable sources I have read today the need for a $1M line of credit to create a marketplace and a recurring install charge all but kill any exciting new innovation.

This morning felt like moment of genuine excitement. But then as it trundled on a hollow feeling took over as I realised I am rapidly losing respect for a company I have loved for so long.
