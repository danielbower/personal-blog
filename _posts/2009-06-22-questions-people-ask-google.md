Nick who works at eConversions came across this little easter egg on Google.  If you punch in the beginning to a question, Google, using it’s suggest feature, will try and preempt you based upon the questions it is most commonly asked. Some pf them are hilarious, here’s a few:

* “Is Lady Gaga a man?”

* “Is Jade Goody dead?”

* “Is Jade Goody dead yet?”

* “Are vampires real?”

* “Are ghosts real?”

* “Are there aliens in space?”

* “Are there snakes in Ireland?”

* “Are there tigers in Africa?”

and of course...

* “Are there any Michael Jackson tickets left?”

I really hope these people got the answer they were looking for.
