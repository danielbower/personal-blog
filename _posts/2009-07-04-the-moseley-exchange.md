I was able to pop down to the opening of [The Moseley Exchange](http://www.moseleyexchange.com/) on Sunday, a new community workspace for the area, and, one of the first of it’s kind in Birmingham I believe.

It’s a large airy open space that is perfect for informal meetings, and if you’re in the mood to get down to some proper work then there are separate private meeting rooms available too. I was particularly impressed with the Ubuntu desktops they have running, a free, open source OS is much more in keeping with the ethos of the place.

[Membership](http://www.moseleyexchange.com/?page_id=31) starts at £10 a month.
