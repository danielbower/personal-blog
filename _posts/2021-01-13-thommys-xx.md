### What non-2020 songs / albums / artists will you forever associate with this year?

For their, I miss my friends nostalgic quality, [All My Friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygY5OqMuKE) and [1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aeETEoNfOg) got played quite a bit.

I also rewatched The British Office (see nostalgia point above) and remembered how good the scene when Dawn and Tim first kiss is. Only You is playing in the background, which also appears in Normal People. Then it quickly became my two year olds favourite song which means it’s been on repeat even since, and I now can’t stand it.

“More 'azzoooo?”

He even likes the weird best of album cover that has two manakins on it...

### What new apps have you been using in 2020?

If you ever find yourself writing something over ~2,000 words you need to ditch Word/Docs and download [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview).

I also switched from Spotify to Tidal. Turns out the lossless quality and lack of royal podcasts is worth the extra money.

After the events of 2020 I think we all deserve a look in for this one.

Snowdog. They give him a plane for fucks sake.

I May Destroy You's killer soundtrack.
