Imagine my surprise on joining NHS England to discover that it had a secret sugar addiction. Not the kind that you might find in staff vending machine, but the kind of sugary hit that comes for craving in-year benefits. 

What are in-year benefits I hear you say? Well, unfortunately, to answer that question requires you enter the wonderful world of public sector programme management, so forgive me while we take this brief detour.

# Identifying benefits

In simple terms a benefit is a measurable improvement to an outcome perceived as valuable by a stakeholder.<a id="ref1" href="#ftn1"><sup>1</sup></a> That is a little jargon heavy so here's a worked example.

Imagine that I (the stakeholder) employ you to help me be a faster runner. And together we agree that a faster 10K time would be evidence of success in helping me achieve my goal (outcome). In doing so, we have now identified a benefit. We know it's a benefit because I perceive being a faster runner as valuable and because it can be measured, in this case in time.

Measurement is important because it means the benefit can be "realised", which is just a fancy way of saying we can document it having happened. So, if we return to our running example, we can book in some 10K races for me over the course of the year, they can be timed and we can provide evidence of that, maybe on my Strava profile.

When I first encountered the notion of benefits last year they immediately made sense to me. It reminded of a common question in product management, "how will you measure success?" and the practice of building a financial model with "drivers" for a burgeoning startup. In fact, I would go as far as to say that centring work in the public sector around the idea of positive outcomes can only be a good thing.

But here comes the twist, and it's the demand for _in-year_ benefits.

# What the hell are in-year benefits?

Let's return to my running example. It turns out that I am a pretty demanding employer and want to see results pretty fast. In fact, I want to starting realising the benefits we agreed on in the same calendar year that your efforts as my trainer begin. This is what I mean when I say in-year benefits.

Now for running this might be practical. The amazing [Couch to 5K programme](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/get-active/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/) aims to take a non-runner to a 5K race in 9 weeks. But for the kind of digital transformation that is required in the NHS? 

For that you need much longer time horizons.

# Placing bets on the future

When I started hearing about in-year benefits my mind immediately turned (as it often does) to the 20 years I spent prior to my work in the NHS, building and investing in startups.

Whether you are building a startup, or investing in one, you are taking a bet on the future. Importantly, that future time horizon is probably 5-10 years from the moment you decide to part with your time or money. You won't raise millions of pounds for your startup based on what it can deliver this year. Nor would you invest money in a startup that's goal was immediate profit maximisation. Publicly traded technology stocks tell the same story. Today NVIDIA is the most valuable company in the world because of NVIDIA's centrality to computing, but also because of the promise of future transformed by artificial intelligence.

This idea of a bet on the future is grounded in evidence too. The technology lifecycle, or s-curve, shows us that the benefits of technological innovation take time to diffuse and therefore time to realise. You could be blown over by some wonder tool and desperate to invest, but it is likely to spend its first years in R&D and as the plaything of early adopters.

Dylan Field took the first investment in Figma back in 2012. It took another four years before it hit private beta, and it wasn’t until September 2016 that it was released publicly.

You place a bet on the future because that’s where the biggest wins come from. It’s the time horizon in which genuine transformation occurs.

# On the 10 Year Plan

If the idea of bets on the future sound familiar it might be because you saw the inclusion of ‘big bets’ throughout the [10 Year Plan for Healthcare in England](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6888a0b1a11f859994409147/fit-for-the-future-10-year-health-plan-for-england.pdf). In fact, the section on the shift from analogue to digital talks specifically of big bets on AI health assistants, seamless data flow, predictive analysis using genomics, robotics and real-time care via wearables. It reads just like the pitch deck of a technology company and I am sure that this was the vibe the document was intended to give off.

It is easy to be cynical of these bets, but the ambition I heard from central government was critical to my own decision to join the NHS. I am excited by the big bets and the hardest problems and there is no organisation in the world that has them like the NHS. 

But the attention I have seen given to in-year benefits as part of multi-year business cases runs counter to the hope of the 10 Year Plan, and counter to everything I have learned from my career in technology to date.  It incentivises completely the wrong behaviou, encouraging teams to prioritise the short-term value they can deliver now, rather than the long-term ambition of the 10 Year Plan.

Are our teams not trusted? Is this the behaviour of an organisation too beholden to the political cycle? Should we fund teams and not programmes? 

It’s seeking a sugar hit.

It’s being entered into a marathon, but being asked to work on your sprint.

It’s safe bets, not big bets.

But most important of all, it doesn't create an NHS that is fit for the future.
