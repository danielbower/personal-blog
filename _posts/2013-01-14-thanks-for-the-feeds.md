It’s not uncommon for people to talk about things that have had a defining impact on their life: albums, songs, films, books, holidays are all typical. I’m no different. I remember the first time I listened to Kid A, watched Dr. Strangelove and when I travelled around Iceland. But being who I am I also remember technology. Something that has had a much more profound effect on my life to date. I remember getting a Macintosh Performa, and plugging a 56k modem into it. I remember downloading my first MP3 and later getting a first gen. iPod. I also remember learning about RSS. I remember plugging in a ton of feeds into Bloglines and suddenly having access to a world of content that I could digest in a way that I never could before. I plugged in feed after feed and consumed as much as I could. I owe a lot to where I am today to that wonderful piece of technology.
