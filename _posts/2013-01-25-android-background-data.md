Ever since owning a “smartphone” I’ve just factored mobile data abroad into the cost of any holiday. If there was ever a time when having access to data on the move is useful, it’s when in a foreign country, and yet it’s the time when it costs the most. Ridiculous.

While away this week I noticed for the first time that Android includes an option to ‘Restrict background data’ which in essence turns off any data transfer when you’re not using the app.

Simply turn it on when abroad (and allow data roaming) and you’ll only be charged for data when the app is in the foreground. Combine this with a global data restriction and you’ve got yourself a great cost saver.

Another one for your list of reasons to swap to Android.
