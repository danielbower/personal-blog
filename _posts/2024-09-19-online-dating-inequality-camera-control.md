→ [Online Dating Caused a Rise in US Income Inequality, Research Paper Shows](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-14/online-dating-caused-a-rise-in-us-income-inequality-research-paper-shows?embedded-checkout=true)

Bloomberg reported on eye catching [academic study](https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2023/2023-023.pdf) this week. It would seem that dating app filters are widening inequality because they allow users to hide the accounts of people based on socio-economic markers like employment and graduate level education. The story reminded my of Bowker and Star's book [Sorting Things Out](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4738/Sorting-Things-OutClassification-and-Its) on the topic of data labelling. As the study highlights pretty pointedly, Bowker and Star were spot on in their assertion  that all data classification is an inherently political decision – even if it doesn't seem so at the time.

It also reminded me of the phenomenon through history that have resulted in an *increased* number of marriages across socio-economic groups. For example: urbanisation, widening participation in education and more women in the workplace. A decade ago, I think there would have been some hope that digital networks were going to support this phenomenon too. But if online dating is struggling to provide evidence of that, I am not sure where else we can look?

Gruber has a great write up of the new Camera Control button in his post on the iPhone 16. I currently use the action button –previously the silent on/off button until they realised no one has their phone on "loud" anymore– to launch [pure](https://purecamera.app), so having a dedicated button for this, which also acts as a shutter AND has the necessary APIs for third parties is pretty cool. Grumber also notes just how sophisticated the camera app on iOS is now. A point that supports my post on [the beauty of pure camera]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-09-10-pure-camera-default %}).
