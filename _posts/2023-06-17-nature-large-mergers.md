og: "The Politics of Big Mergers"

A couple of interesting ideas from Matt Stoller when considering a large corporate merger.

First, a large merger can signal that the operational effectiveness of a firm is in decline. Meaning, they may have stopped growing / innovating as a result of their own effort, and so they switch focus to a "market organisation", i.e. greater concentration of power. This idea dovetailed with this tweet yesterday about a tech company being finished when their CEO starts [thinking of themselves as capital allocator](https://twitter.com/Altimor/status/1669678741096734720_).

Second, big mergers are often driven by the interest of a high ranking exec within the acquiring firm. And, that when they fail, keep an eye out in the following months for someone high profile being shown the door. Stoller wonders if that is what will happen to Brad Smith if [Microsoft's acquisition of Activistion ends up in the mud](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/lina-khan-fires-a-crooked-ceo).
