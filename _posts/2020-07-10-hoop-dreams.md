I’ve been queuing up a post about local e-commerce (!) for the last week or so but it seems like it would be odd not to post about Hoop before that.

I have no interest in writing one of those “what happened” posts. I’ve got it all written down in my diary, and so if the story could be of genuine use to you, get in touch and I’ll be more than happy to share.

Instead, all I want to say is that running Hoop for the past five a bit years has been the most incredible experience and I feel lucky to have been given the chance to do it.

I got to work on a problem that interested me, build the product I wanted to, and got to work with an incredible bunch of people who were as talented as they were fun to be around. As Humberto our former Head of Design said to me:

> It wasn’t work, every single moment was play!
