The Automation Paradox or the Automation Myth asks why, despite many claims to the contrary, has automation yet to create widespread unemployment? Two things caused me to return to this question in recent months. First, the public beta of the ChatGPT, the text synthesis app from OpenAI. Second, finishing James Bessen's fantastic book, 'The New Goliaths'.

The launch of ChatGPT followed many predictable claims that whole industries would soon be devoid of human labour. Ethan Mollick, was then quick to remind people that [only one job from the 1950 US census has been eradicated by automation and that was the elevator operator](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1605209602500743168).

In reality, novel inventions such text synthesis *augment* human labour and make those individuals, and the companies they work for, more productive. In turn this new productive capacity causes a reduction in the cost of producing goods and services.

So why no new found leisure time or mass unemployment? Well here James Bessen's timely new book provided great insight. The piece that is so often missing is an appreciation of what reduced costs do to demand. If the addressable market expands with price drops, the new productive capacity doesn't result in layoffs, it results in new customers. In economic terms, greater automation expands markets that are price elastic.

This is by no means a conclusive answer to the automation myth. Many industries are price inelastic and so be definition will exhibit different behaviour, and as [Matthew Yglesias pointed out in his long piece for Vox](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9038829/automation-myth), part of the problem developed nations face is that robots *are not* taking / augmenting our work fast enough.

That said, understanding how automation and demand can work in concert was revelatory for my understanding of the topic, and is just one of many great reasons to read Bessen's new book.
