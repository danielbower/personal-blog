I have an active interest in US elections and particularly the amount of money that is now being spent in them thanks to the Citizens United ruling.

If you’re looking for a book that unveils the sheers scale of money being poured now into US politics there are few better books to read than [Ken Vogels’ Big Money](http://www.bigmoneybook.net/). Indeed, it’s only by following the money that you understand what motivates US political candidates, which makes it not just a book about elections, but one about the machinations of the entire political landscape.

I particularly enjoyed learning about the ‘Kochtopus’ as Vogel refers to it. The sprawling politic network funded by the Kock Brothers and their allies. I asked Vogel if he thought they could be the precursor to new parties forming on the right. What I didn’t expect was us to end up having a phone call about it! Not only a good writer, but clearly a nice guy too.
