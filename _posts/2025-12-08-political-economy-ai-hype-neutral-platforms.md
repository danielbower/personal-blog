Lots of great insight here from Cory, but I was particularly draw to his description of what I called the "political economy of hype" in a [previous post on web3](https://danielbower.com/2022/01/07/political-economy-web3-hype). What's nice about Cory's addition is that it addresses the topic from the perspective of publicly traded stocks, whereas I was interested in venture backed startups. The point is never-the-less the same, hype serves financial ends, and the intensity of a hype cycle is particularly ferocious when interests converge.

Adam Aleksic, author of [Algospeak](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/468266/algospeak-by-aleksic-adam/9781529949148) makes a great observation regarding us of the word platform. Platforms or soapboxes were historically neutral in that they allowed a speaker to rise above a crowd to speak directly to them. A modern day social media platform makes choices about the reach of the messages its users send, and in-doing so alters the nature of the communication too. Now, those messages are increasingly co-authored by a platform-owned LLM too.
