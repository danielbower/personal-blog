It's nicely counter intuitive to think that a successful merger could be signal that a company is losing its operational effectiveness. I think it's much more common to admire the acquisitive prowess of companies like Alphabet, Disney or Meta. And yet, the idea that a company that focusses on market organisation over innovation is in decline is compeelling. It also aligns with [this recent tweet from Flo Crivelo](https://twitter.com/Altimor/status/1669678741096734720).
